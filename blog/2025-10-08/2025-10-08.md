This blog post describes why I am trying to build a router that combines declarative infrastructure with programmable networking.

This is my origin story.

<!-- truncate -->

1. Custom Kernel Modules -> eBPF
1. NFV -> VNF -> CNF
1. ??? -> Kubernetes

Both infrastructure and networking have advanced dramatically, but theyâ€™re still rarely operated as one coherent system.

Over the years, infrastructure has become declarative, and networks have become programmable.
Despite these advancements, infrastructure and networks are rarely operated as one coherent system.

The concepts of desired stated and convergence have driven adoption of Cloud Native principles.


Infrastructure and networks are rarely operated as one coherent system. Infrastructure as Code made infrastructure declarative. Software Defined Networking made networks programmable. This course is where innovative techonologies collide.
