**Greetings networking enthusiasts!**

I'm excited to announce the pilot launch of *Bare Metal Networking for Private Clouds*. This blog will share updates, tips, and behind-the-scenes insights as we develop the course.

In this initial version, you'll find:
- A fully guided Section 1 lab on building an IPv6-only underlay.
- Conceptual primers on L3 fabrics, unnumbered BGP, and more.
- A preview of how eBPF and service chaining will play into modern data center networks.

Stay tuned for frequent updates as we expand content, refine labs, and incorporate feedback from early participants. Thank you for joining me on this journey to master modern network engineering!

*â€“ Steven*
