title: "Section 3: Networking with eBPF"
description: "Develop eBPF-based network functions and achieve kernel-level performance."
---


We will explain each line at great length, covering:
	- Learn how to Read, Write, Build (Cross Compile), and Containerize eBPF programs.
	- Learn how to Deploy Containerized eBPF programs into a Bare-Metal Kubernetes cluster
	- Service Function Chaining using `NETKIT_NEXT` and `NETKIT_REDIRECT`.

We'll cover the Program Types, Map Types, and Kernel Hooks that are relevant to our eBPF program. We'll also address tradeoffs, in ADR fashion, so you know why certain decisions were made in lieu of other options.
	- We will also point to other references (official docs, etc.) if course participants want to dive deeper into alternative types and options.
