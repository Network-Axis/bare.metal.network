description: "Design a spine-leaf IPv6 fabric with unnumbered BGP, ECMP, and <50ms failover."
---

In this section, we will design a spine-leaf IPv6 fabric with unnumbered BGP, ECMP, BFD.

> Discuss the protocols and topology of the underlying network to build a .
1. **How the Data Center has evolved, and how to make it scale**: Discuss Pure Layer 3 Underlay and how BFD is used for sub-second link failover to meet high availability SLAs
    - IPv6 is used for easy management of IP addresses. Using Neighbor Discovery Protocol and Link-Local Addresses, we can achieve Route Advertisement without any configuration.
    - Spine and Leaf Topology is used to avoid the overhead of Layer 2 networking.
	- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used for load balancing and advertising routes to all servers, routers, and switches. In terms of scalability, BGP is currently handling ~700,000 routes of the public internet. BGP can use link-local addresses to exchange information about IP addresses configured in a data center.
	- BIG TCP: Extends TCP's window-scaling and congestion control, improving performance and throughput as packets enter the networking stack.
	- BBRv3 is used for
	- Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is used for
