Load balance, routing, and controlling HTTP(S) traffic as it enters our network (cluster) is achieved with Gateway API.

Gateway API capabilities:
- HTTP routing
- HTTP traffic splitting and load-balancing
- HTTP request and response header rewrite
- HTTP redirect and path rewrites
- HTTP mirroring
- Cross-namespace routing
- TLS termination and passthrough
- gRPC routing

## Advertising Routes

### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Cilium can advertise the LoadBalancer Service IPs or the PodCIDR ranges to the rest of the network.

BGP allows to announce IP addresses for pods and services

| Feature                     | LoadBalancer IPs                            | PodCIDRs                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Traffic Type**           | External (to Services)                      | Internal (to Pods)                        |
| **Common Use Case**        | Bare metal LoadBalancer routing             | Direct pod communication / routing        |
| **Granularity**            | Per-Service                                 | Per-Node                                  |
| **Requires local endpoint?** | Yes (if `ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local`)    | No                                        |
| **Configuration Flag**     | `bgp-announce-lb-ip`                        | BGP speaker config with PodCIDR range     |

“Requires local endpoint?” means the BGP speaker will only announce the LoadBalancer IP if it actually has a pod backing the service on that node — this is controlled by `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`.

Once the peering session is established and routes are advertised/exchanged, the rest of the network and access applications hosted in the Kubernetes cluster.

The Cilium CLI command `cilium bgp peers` can be used to verify peering sessions have been established and routes are being advertised.

Better suited for data center networks

- Cilium leverages eBPF to connect its agents to existing BGP infrastructure, allowing to:
    - announce Pod CIDRs for direct routing, both inside the cluster and outside of it
    - announce service IPs (both LoadBalancer and ClusterIP) on the network
    - tune BGP parameters such as eBGP multihop, MD5 authentication, and communities

### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
When the client is on the same network as the Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service, BGP is not necessary.
Better suited for homelabs.
