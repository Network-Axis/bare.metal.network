Traffic between pods, nodes, and clusters can be encrypted using either IPsec or Wireguard.

Using the Transparent Encryption feature encrypts communication between pods as long as they are on different nodes.

IPsec allows more flexibility: key management, and the ability to choose the cipher and algorithm.

WireGuard: opinionated, no flexibility.
