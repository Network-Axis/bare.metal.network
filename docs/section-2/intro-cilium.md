Cilium secure the network connectivity between application services deployed using Kubernetes.

At the foundation of Cilium is eBPF, which enables security, visibility, and control logic.

Cilium security policies can be applied and updated without any changes to the application code or container configuration.
This is because eBPF runs inside the Linux kernel.
