### A New Take on Routing and Switching
In this section, we will learn how to automate the provisioning Kubernetes cluster via Talos Linux and the configuration of Cilium.
Once we bootstrap the Kubernetes cluster, we will integrate it into the L3 fabric to create a programmable router.

1. Configure Cilium Helm Chart
2. Configure Talos Linux
3. Configure Cilium manifests
4. [Tuning Ciliun](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/operations/performance/tuning/) for optimal performance
